# RobustFPLM
## Robust estimators for Functional Partial Linear Models 

This repository contains code to compute the robust MM-estimators 
for Functional Partial Linear models in Boente, Salibian-Barrera, Vena (2019).

### Tecator example
Because the regression model of the Tecator data includes an 
interaction between the non-parametric 
term `g` and a scalar covariate `w` (specifically, the model is
`y = <X, beta> + w * g(z) + e`, where `X` is the functional 
predictor, `w` and `z` are
scalar variables, and `g` is a smooth unknown function), setting 
the appropriate design matrices
(including splitting the data into a training and a testing set, 
and computing the 2nd derivatives
of the absorbance spectra) requires special care. 
Thus, we prepared a suite of specific 
functions and scripts to reproduce our analysis in the paper. 
See [here](tecator-specific-functions.R) and [here](script-TECATOR.R).

### General code
Code to fit the usual Functional Partial linear Model 
(`y = <X, beta> + g(z) + e`) is [here](FPLM-Bsplines-functions.R). A 
simple step-by-step example can be found 
[here](FPLM-Bsplines-example.R).
